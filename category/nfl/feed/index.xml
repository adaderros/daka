										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Legendary American football coach Bill Belichick has returned to the game after a year out but not as a coach in the NFL.</p>
<p>The 72-year-old, who won a record six Super Bowls with the New England Patriots, has become head coach of the University of North Carolina.</p>
<p>After ending his 24-year spell with the Patriots at the end of last season, Belichick was interviewed by the NFL&#8217;s Atlanta Falcons but not offered a role.</p>
<p>Instead he fulfilled a number of broadcasting roles this season before accepting a three-year deal with the Tar Heels, worth a reported $30m (Â£23.5m).</p>
<p>Belichick&#8217;s father, Steve Belichick, was an assistant coach at UNC from 1953-55. Bill Belichick takes over a Tar Heels programme that has not won a conference title since 1980.</p>
<p>Belichick said in a statement released by UNC: &#8220;I am excited for the opportunity. I grew up around college football with my dad and treasured those times.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have always wanted to coach in college and now I look forward to building the football programme in Chapel Hill.&#8221;</p>
