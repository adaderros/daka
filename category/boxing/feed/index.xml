										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oleksandr Usyk and Tyson Fury step into the ring together again on 21 December in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The rival heavyweights collided six months ago in Riyadh, with Usyk narrowly beating Fury via split decision.</p>
<p>It was a historic night with Usyk becoming the modern era&#8217;s first four-belt heavyweight champion and they will do it all again in an early Christmas present for sports fans.</p>
<p>Live text commentary will start at 20:00 GMT on fight night on the BBC Sport website and app.</p>
<p>Can Fury avenge his only loss or will Usyk&#8217;s incredible, unblemished career continue?</p>
<p>Everything you need to know about the WBA, WBO and WBC heavyweight world title fight is below.</p>
<p>When is Usyk v Fury 2 and what are the UK times?<br />
Ringwalk timings in Saudi have been a bit hit and miss in the last 12 months. Some fights have begun well after midnight while others have started closer to 22:00.</p>
<p>Organisers in Riyadh this time are aiming for the earlier end of that spectrum.</p>
<p>The undercard is set to start at 18:00 GMT. Usyk v Fury 2 is targeted to start around 22:00.</p>
<p>There is usually a musical guest who plays between the co-main and main event, so when that act appears it is a good indication the headline fight is not far away.</p>
<p>How to follow Usyk v Fury 2 on the BBC?<br />
BBC Sport will bring you daily coverage from Riyadh in fight week and Steve Bunce will deliver daily episodes of his 5 Live Boxing with Steve Bunce podcast.</p>
<p>You can follow live text commentary from 20:00 GMT on Saturday, 21 December on the BBC Sport website and app.</p>
<p>You will be able to follow the undercard action as well as all the build-up and reaction to the main event.</p>
<p>Who is on the Usyk v Fury 2 undercard and what is the running order?<br />
Oleksandr Usyk v Tyson Fury 2 &#8211; WBC, WBO &amp; WBA heavyweight titles</p>
<p>Serhii Bohachuk v Ishmael Davis &#8211; light-middleweight</p>
<p>Moses Itauma v Demsey McKean &#8211; heavyweight</p>
<p>Johnny Fisher v Dave Allen &#8211; heavyweight</p>
<p>Dennis McCann v Peter McGrail &#8211; European super-bantamweight title</p>
<p>Isaac Lowe v Lee McGregor &#8211; featherweight</p>
<p>What is the Usyk v Fury 2 fight week schedule?<br />
Tuesday &#8211; grand arrivals from 18:00 GMT</p>
<p>Wednesday &#8211; open workout from 18:00</p>
<p>Thursday &#8211; news conference from 16:00</p>
<p>Friday &#8211; weigh-in from 18:00</p>
<p>How do Usyk and Fury&#8217;s records compare?</p>
<p>Just as with the first fight, Usyk v Fury 2 is a contest of fine margins.</p>
<p>Usyk, 37, has collected all the belts at heavyweight and cruiserweight.</p>
<p>Ukraine&#8217;s golden boy is unbeaten in 22 fights with 14 knockouts and showed every inch of his capabilities in his last bout.</p>
<p>Usyk&#8217;s best attribute continues to be his boxing brain and fantastic movement. The victory over Fury was the best win of his career, but Usyk has also beaten Anthony Joshua, Daniel Dubois and Tony Bellew.</p>
<p>Fury, 36, has a big reach and height advantage, with six inches separating the two towering heavyweights.</p>
<p>A clever person might suggest Fury will put his seven-inch reach advantage to better use in the rematch.</p>
<p>The loss to Usyk was Fury&#8217;s first in 16 years as a pro as his record changed to 34 wins, one defeat and one draw.</p>
<p>Fury has held every title at heavyweight, albeit not at the same time. His best wins have been over Deontay Wilder, Wladimir Klitschko and Dillian Whyte.</p>
<p>As both heavyweights creep towards 40 years of age, miles on the clock might play a big part in the rematch.</p>
<p>Usyk is the fresher, in the pro game at least, having competed in 14 fewer fights than Fury&#8217;s 36 bouts.</p>
<p>As well as that, Fury has boxed a huge 242 rounds compared to Usyk&#8217;s 189.</p>
