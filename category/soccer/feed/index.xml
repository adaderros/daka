										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Liverpool FC staff Christmas party in the city&#8217;s Anglican cathedral was shut down early amid reports that suspected drugs paraphernalia were found.</p>
<p>The football club confirmed an &#8220;incident&#8221; had taken place on Thursday night, adding: &#8220;We do not condone or tolerate the use of illegal substances at any of our sites or events.&#8221;</p>
<p>None of the club&#8217;s players or first team manager Arne Slot were in attendance at the event, which was held for non-footballing staff.</p>
<p>The party was ended by staff at the cathedral, which said in a statement that an &#8220;incident&#8221; occurred &#8220;that was not in line with our values&#8221;.</p>
<p>The details emerged in newspaper reports, which said a search was prompted by one of the attendees suffering a &#8220;medical episode&#8221;.</p>
<p>Liverpool FC said the staff member was &#8220;recovering well&#8221; after hospital treatment and the medical incident was &#8220;unrelated&#8221; to the other concerns.</p>
