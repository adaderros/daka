										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The returning Diogo Jota scored a late equaliser as Premier League leaders Liverpool twice fought back with 10 men to deny Fulham following Andy Robertson&#8217;s red card at Anfield.</p>
<p>Jota, sidelined with injury since October, slotted in an 86th-minute leveller after Rodrigo Muniz looked to have ended the Reds&#8217; second-half resistance.</p>
<p>Cody Gakpo&#8217;s header from Mohamed Salah&#8217;s sublime cross shortly after half-time had cancelled out Andreas Pereira&#8217;s 11th-minute opener.</p>
<p>Six minutes after Pereira volleyed Fulham ahead, Liverpool&#8217;s task became even tougher when Robertson was dismissed for denying Harry Wilson a goalscoring opportunity.</p>
<p>While Fulham centre-back Issa Diop had earlier escaped with a booking for a high challenge on the offside Robertson, there was no such fortune for the Liverpool left-back and a lengthy video assistant referee (VAR) review confirmed Wilson was onside before pouncing on his mistake.</p>
<p>After Wilson fizzed the resulting free-kick narrowly over Alisson&#8217;s goal, Liverpool reset and continued to cause Fulham problems &#8211; but Luis Diaz headed over the hosts&#8217; best chance before half-time.</p>
<p>However, a re-energised Liverpool stormed out of the blocks in the second half and Gakpo&#8217;s instant leveller after the restart sparked the Anfield crowd into life.</p>
<p>Fulham&#8217;s failure to capitalise on their numerical advantage fuelled Liverpool&#8217;s belief and Salah twice went close to completing the turnaround but could not find the target before Muniz delivered a sucker punch.</p>
<p>There was to be one final twist late in an enthralling contest when Jota marked his return with a fine finish to set up a chaotic, breathless conclusion, with both sides made to settle for a point.</p>
<p>After a thrilling 3-3 draw with Newcastle 10 days ago, Liverpool&#8217;s title rivals were able to make up further ground after last weekend&#8217;s Merseyside derby against Everton was postponed by severe weather.</p>
<p>But they extended their lead over Chelsea, who host Brentford on Sunday, to five points after third-place Arsenal were held to a goalless draw by Everton.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Liverpool FC staff Christmas party in the city&#8217;s Anglican cathedral was shut down early amid reports that suspected drugs paraphernalia were found.</p>
<p>The football club confirmed an &#8220;incident&#8221; had taken place on Thursday night, adding: &#8220;We do not condone or tolerate the use of illegal substances at any of our sites or events.&#8221;</p>
<p>None of the club&#8217;s players or first team manager Arne Slot were in attendance at the event, which was held for non-footballing staff.</p>
<p>The party was ended by staff at the cathedral, which said in a statement that an &#8220;incident&#8221; occurred &#8220;that was not in line with our values&#8221;.</p>
<p>The details emerged in newspaper reports, which said a search was prompted by one of the attendees suffering a &#8220;medical episode&#8221;.</p>
<p>Liverpool FC said the staff member was &#8220;recovering well&#8221; after hospital treatment and the medical incident was &#8220;unrelated&#8221; to the other concerns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Olympic rowing champion Imogen Grant walks down the red carpet at Sports Personality of the Year on Tuesday, she will be wearing a special dress.</p>
<p>It is the result of a unique project which enabled Grant to combine her passions for sustainability with high fashion.</p>
<p>The 28-year old, who was named BBC Green Sports Awards Athlete of the Year, donated her old sports kits to the London College of Fashion so they could be upcycled into a dress she will wear at the awards.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s an amazing project, and I really hope it sends a message,&#8221; said Grant, who won gold in Paris alongside Emily Craig in the women&#8217;s lightweight double sculls.</p>
<p>&#8220;As athletes we get given lots of kit and so much of it gets wasted. As soon as a sponsor changes, a whole new set comes in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope this shows there&#8217;s another life it can have. The way we make kit at the moment is just not sustainable.&#8221;</p>
<p>It took two months to create the dress, with maker Aishvarya Verma facing several technical challenges.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had to work with lots of different fabrics that weren&#8217;t manufactured for an evening dress,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I would say the hardest part was taking the pieces apart because we did not want to waste anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Six items of kit have been used in the final design &#8211; each with a story to tell &#8211; and it took Verma seven days to unpick the stitching of just one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;The front section is the kit I wore when I won the gold medal in Paris,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;There&#8217;s kit that I raced in and trained in when I was a newbie on the GB team.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve set world-best times wearing some of it, and they&#8217;ve even used part of the jacket I wore for the opening ceremony at the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back in October, when I handed over a big bag of kit I had no idea how they were going to transform it &#8211; but they&#8217;ve been worked into a red-carpet look.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verma said: &#8220;We wanted to blend her memories into one dress.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Legendary American football coach Bill Belichick has returned to the game after a year out but not as a coach in the NFL.</p>
<p>The 72-year-old, who won a record six Super Bowls with the New England Patriots, has become head coach of the University of North Carolina.</p>
<p>After ending his 24-year spell with the Patriots at the end of last season, Belichick was interviewed by the NFL&#8217;s Atlanta Falcons but not offered a role.</p>
<p>Instead he fulfilled a number of broadcasting roles this season before accepting a three-year deal with the Tar Heels, worth a reported $30m (£23.5m).</p>
<p>Belichick&#8217;s father, Steve Belichick, was an assistant coach at UNC from 1953-55. Bill Belichick takes over a Tar Heels programme that has not won a conference title since 1980.</p>
<p>Belichick said in a statement released by UNC: &#8220;I am excited for the opportunity. I grew up around college football with my dad and treasured those times.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have always wanted to coach in college and now I look forward to building the football programme in Chapel Hill.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Investec Champions Cup</p>
<p>Bulls (7) 21</p>
<p>Tries: Coetzee, Hanekom 2 Cons: Goosen 3</p>
<p>Northampton (12) 30</p>
<p>Tries: Hendy, Augustus, Freeman 2 Cons: Smith 2 Pens: Smith 2</p>
<p>Tommy Freeman scored two tries as Northampton produced a display of outstanding spirit in the altitude and heat to earn a Champions Cup bonus-point win over Bulls in South Africa.</p>
<p>The victory keeps up Northampton&#8217;s perfect start in Pool Three, with two wins from two and a maximum 10 points.</p>
<p>In physically demanding conditions in Pretoria, the Saints held out in the face of the Bulls&#8217; power, and rode the loss of captain George Furbank with an arm injury, to lead just after the half-hour mark through George Hendy.</p>
<p>The full-back, barely on for two minutes as Furbank&#8217;s replacement, took on Fin Smith&#8217;s offload after Fraser Dingwall had charged at the Bulls defence.</p>
<p>Bulls were quickly in front as Marcell Coetzee evaded Dingwall&#8217;s tackle and pumped through to score a try converted by Johan Goosen.</p>
<p>Northampton faced a further setback right at the end of the first half when prop Emmanuel Iyogun was sent to the sin-bin.</p>
<p>But with the first-half clock in the red, and barely a minute after being reduced to 14 players, the visitors restored their lead as Alex Mitchell took a quick tap penalty and opened up the Bulls defence for Juarno Augustus to go over in the corner.</p>
<p>The Bulls had seen two tries ruled out in an opening half hour where they somehow failed to turn their physical dominance into points &#8211; and then another disallowed early in the second half as Canan Moodie failed to ground the ball as he chased a kick through.</p>
<p>Smith extended the lead with a penalty, before Freeman capitalised on a line-out to burst through David Kriel&#8217;s tackle &#8211; with the television match official ruling that he had managed to get the ball down.</p>
<p>But Cameron Hanekom surged out of a scrum and bounced off the referee to evade Mitchell and score to give the hosts hope.</p>
<p>Then the number eight repeated the trick to bring the hosts back to within a point with 10 minutes left.</p>
<p>Smith took advantage of the altitude to land a penalty almost from halfway, and was narrowly off target with a drop-goal attempt from nearly as far out &#8211; before Freeman dived over again in the final four minutes to seal a bonus point and a memorable victory.</p>
<p>Saints demonstrate heart as Bulls waste chances<br />
The Premiership champions, who have struggled for form domestically so far this season, began their European campaign with a 38-8 victory over an under-strength Castres last weekend, but this was a very different test.</p>
<p>In temperatures topping 30C in Pretoria, they had to work hard just to hang on for the opening half hour, suffering a setback when Furbank was forced off, using his shirt as a makeshift sling to cradle his right arm after being clattered by Bulls captain Elrigh Louw.</p>
<p>Northampton were undoubtedly helped in the early stages by Bulls&#8217; lack of ruthlessness. The hosts may have dominated physically, causing the visitors all sorts of trouble in the scrum, but failed to convert that into points when the door appeared to be wide open.</p>
<p>The Saints conceded four penalties in the opening 15 minutes &#8211; with Iyogun twice penalised for collapsing the scrum &#8211; and twice escaped as their hosts had tries ruled out, while Goosen also dropped the ball barely a couple of metres from the line.</p>
<p>That came after Devon Williams had gone clear from an Embrose Papier pass over the top to dive in at the corner &#8211; with Goosen actually adding the conversion before the try was pulled back for review and ruled out because of an obstruction by Willie le Roux.</p>
<p>Then former Sale hooker Akker van der Merwe darted over to dot down, but referee Luc Ramos had already blown his whistle for an obstruction by JF van Heerden.</p>
<p>Northampton lost Iyogun, yet not only negotiated his 10-minute absence without conceding any points, but also turned a deficit into a lead through Augustus&#8217; score.</p>
<p>The Bulls&#8217; attacking profligacy haunted them again as Moodie and Le Roux chased a kick over the top, with the centre just winning the race &#8211; but as Goosen was lining up the kick, the television match official was called in once more, and ruled that the ball had not been grounded.</p>
<p>When Freeman extended the Northampton lead to 22-7, the win looked there for the taking &#8211; but there was always the danger they would tire in the heat, and the impressive Hanekom&#8217;s double score increased their anxiety.</p>
<p>It was to Northampton&#8217;s credit that they did not wilt, and Smith and Freeman took the match out of the hosts&#8217; reach.</p>
<p>Line-ups<br />
Bulls: Le Roux, De Klerk, Moodie, Kriel, Williams; Goosen, Papier; Steenekamp, Van der Merwe, Louw, Vermaak, Van Heerden, Coetzee, Louw (capt), Hanekom.</p>
<p>Replacements: Wessels, Tshakweni, Klopper, Slabbert, Nama Xaba, Burger, Chamberlain, Gans.</p>
<p>Northampton: Furbank (capt); Freeman, Dingwall, Hutchinson, Sleightholme; Smith, Mitchell; Iyogun, Langdon, Millar-Mills, Mayanavanua, Lockett, Coles, Pollock, Augustus.</p>
<p>Replacements: Wright, Haffar, Davison, Munga, Scott-Young, Pearson, McParland, Hendy.</p>
<p>Referee: Luc Ramos (France)</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oleksandr Usyk and Tyson Fury step into the ring together again on 21 December in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The rival heavyweights collided six months ago in Riyadh, with Usyk narrowly beating Fury via split decision.</p>
<p>It was a historic night with Usyk becoming the modern era&#8217;s first four-belt heavyweight champion and they will do it all again in an early Christmas present for sports fans.</p>
<p>Live text commentary will start at 20:00 GMT on fight night on the BBC Sport website and app.</p>
<p>Can Fury avenge his only loss or will Usyk&#8217;s incredible, unblemished career continue?</p>
<p>Everything you need to know about the WBA, WBO and WBC heavyweight world title fight is below.</p>
<p>When is Usyk v Fury 2 and what are the UK times?<br />
Ringwalk timings in Saudi have been a bit hit and miss in the last 12 months. Some fights have begun well after midnight while others have started closer to 22:00.</p>
<p>Organisers in Riyadh this time are aiming for the earlier end of that spectrum.</p>
<p>The undercard is set to start at 18:00 GMT. Usyk v Fury 2 is targeted to start around 22:00.</p>
<p>There is usually a musical guest who plays between the co-main and main event, so when that act appears it is a good indication the headline fight is not far away.</p>
<p>How to follow Usyk v Fury 2 on the BBC?<br />
BBC Sport will bring you daily coverage from Riyadh in fight week and Steve Bunce will deliver daily episodes of his 5 Live Boxing with Steve Bunce podcast.</p>
<p>You can follow live text commentary from 20:00 GMT on Saturday, 21 December on the BBC Sport website and app.</p>
<p>You will be able to follow the undercard action as well as all the build-up and reaction to the main event.</p>
<p>Who is on the Usyk v Fury 2 undercard and what is the running order?<br />
Oleksandr Usyk v Tyson Fury 2 &#8211; WBC, WBO &amp; WBA heavyweight titles</p>
<p>Serhii Bohachuk v Ishmael Davis &#8211; light-middleweight</p>
<p>Moses Itauma v Demsey McKean &#8211; heavyweight</p>
<p>Johnny Fisher v Dave Allen &#8211; heavyweight</p>
<p>Dennis McCann v Peter McGrail &#8211; European super-bantamweight title</p>
<p>Isaac Lowe v Lee McGregor &#8211; featherweight</p>
<p>What is the Usyk v Fury 2 fight week schedule?<br />
Tuesday &#8211; grand arrivals from 18:00 GMT</p>
<p>Wednesday &#8211; open workout from 18:00</p>
<p>Thursday &#8211; news conference from 16:00</p>
<p>Friday &#8211; weigh-in from 18:00</p>
<p>How do Usyk and Fury&#8217;s records compare?</p>
<p>Just as with the first fight, Usyk v Fury 2 is a contest of fine margins.</p>
<p>Usyk, 37, has collected all the belts at heavyweight and cruiserweight.</p>
<p>Ukraine&#8217;s golden boy is unbeaten in 22 fights with 14 knockouts and showed every inch of his capabilities in his last bout.</p>
<p>Usyk&#8217;s best attribute continues to be his boxing brain and fantastic movement. The victory over Fury was the best win of his career, but Usyk has also beaten Anthony Joshua, Daniel Dubois and Tony Bellew.</p>
<p>Fury, 36, has a big reach and height advantage, with six inches separating the two towering heavyweights.</p>
<p>A clever person might suggest Fury will put his seven-inch reach advantage to better use in the rematch.</p>
<p>The loss to Usyk was Fury&#8217;s first in 16 years as a pro as his record changed to 34 wins, one defeat and one draw.</p>
<p>Fury has held every title at heavyweight, albeit not at the same time. His best wins have been over Deontay Wilder, Wladimir Klitschko and Dillian Whyte.</p>
<p>As both heavyweights creep towards 40 years of age, miles on the clock might play a big part in the rematch.</p>
<p>Usyk is the fresher, in the pro game at least, having competed in 14 fewer fights than Fury&#8217;s 36 bouts.</p>
<p>As well as that, Fury has boxed a huge 242 rounds compared to Usyk&#8217;s 189.</p>
